"""write_manifest.py — hash every asset under public/ that the runtime
loads, write public/assets.json mapping asset path → 12-char sha256.

The runtime fetches assets.json first (always no-cache) then appends
`?v=<sha>` to every binary URL. The browser cache key is the full URL
including query string, so:

  - same build  → same sha → cache hit → no network for big binaries
  - new build   → new sha  → fresh fetch (cache transparently invalidated)

Combined with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on the
binaries (set by tools/upload_to_r2.sh), this gives permanent browser
caching with automatic invalidation on rebuild — no IDB, no service worker.

Run after any of: build_csr.py, build_vnc.py, extract_walking_policy.py,
dump_flybody_spec.py. Cheap (a few sha256s over ~100 MB), idempotent.
